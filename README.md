# FRAUD DETECTION IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

## Project Overview
This project develops an AI-based fraud detection system for financial transactions.
Using machine learning, the system analyzes transaction patterns to identify and prevent fraudulent activities, enhancing security and minimizing financial losses.

## Problem Statement
Fraudulent financial transactions pose significant risks to institutions and customers.
Manual monitoring is inefficient and prone to errors.
This project builds a machine learning model that detects fraudulent transactions in real-time, ensuring secure and reliable financial operations.

## Objectives
1. Develop a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques.
2. Implement a real-time transaction monitoring system.
3. Generate alerts and preventive actions for detected fraud.
4. Minimize financial losses and increase trust in financial systems.

## Dataset
- Dataset Name: `creditcard.csv`
- Source: Public dataset or provided for internship/project
- Contents:
  - `Time` – Seconds since the first transaction
  - `Amount` – Transaction amount
  - `V1` to `V28` – PCA-transformed anonymized features
  - `Class` – 1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate

> Note: PCA anonymization ensures sensitive financial information is protected.
